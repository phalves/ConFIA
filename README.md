# ConFIA (Consent Framework to mitigate Informational Asymmetry)

ConFIA aims to use the ConsentOntology (link para consent ontology) to develop pragmatic circumscriptions in a structured manner to evaluate computational adherence and to bridge the gap between agents, i.e., data subjects, controllers, and processors. Moreover, This framework aims to help the agents to explore the circumscription at different times in the timeline, i.e., before, during, and after the consent agreement.

The scenarios were built using Jupyter Prolog (link para Jupyter Prolog) to allow agents to evaluate some possible interpretations in such environment. The result would be used as an piece of evidence regarding the agreement between the parts involved. In this sense, Jupyter Prolog enable the scenarios construction with basic logic (Prolog) and documentation (Jupyter Notebook). The documentation to setup Jupyter Prolog is available at: [JupyterProlog](JupyterProlog.md).

This project starts with three different domain scenarios: [Healthcare](LGPD_Health_Scenario.ipynb), [Educational](LGPD_Eduational_Scenario.ipynb), and [Open Banking](Open_Banking_Scenario.ipynb).

Moreover, this is an open source project, thus, anyone can contribute. As much as scenarios this project have, more the agents would have material to argue their rights.

Last but not least, this project is fruto of an Ph.D Thesis in Brazil.
