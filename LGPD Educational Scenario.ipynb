    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to apply the PrOnto Ontology in the LGPD context. Initially, PrOnto was developed to map the GDPR entities and their relationships; however, as the LGPD as an intense sinergy with GDPR, we also used such an ontology to apply in the LGPD Scenarios. Therefore, the first step was evalute GDPR and LGPD to identify the main differences. The former is more normative and detailed. The latter is generalist and, as law, lets the clauses open to interpretations case by case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LGPD cases can present intersections with other laws in the Brazilian constitution, depending on the case, as depicted in Figure 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "LGPD defines: \n",
    " - legal basis: consent is the most popular, but there are others foreseen in the law, \n",
    " - data protection guidelines: general guidelines, \n",
    " - applicability: there are some situations that the LGPD cannot be applied, such as when the data is anonymized,\n",
    " - concepts: LGPD qualifies personal data, sensitive personal data, data controller, among others,\n",
    " - rights and duties: LGPD sets rights and duties for data subjects, controllers and processors.\n",

    "[comment]: <> (In this sense, we decided to create a straight-to-the-point ontology version to highlight the essential concepts in the LGPD and their relationships. Moreover, we added the auditing concerns to this version, as depicted in the following image.)\n",

    "Fig.2 - GDPR ontology applied to LGPD.. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "In a detailed view, Figure 2 depicts the relationships between the ontology entities, and it is important to note that the \"consent term\" and the \"right\" are the central ontology points; they have many connections with other concepts as well as the entity \"dispute resolution\". For instance, if the purpose limitation changes, the data controller must get a new consent term from the data subject. Hence, depending on the data subject will, he/she can disagree, and it will interrupt the data collection. Still, if the data controller does not stop collecting the data subject's personal data, it will violate its rights, and fines will be applied to the data controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the LGPD did not specify the data processing modalities, we decided to insert information regarding data security, access restriction, technologies applied, and sharing politics. These pieces of information are important to understand the environmental factors related to the scenario execution and explanation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are 10 (ten) legal bases foreseen in the LGPD and we decided to start our study on Consent legal basis. We decided to use consent as a study object because it can be applied in most situations.\n",

    "In this sense, we developed a simulation tool to evaluate the LGPD application in a pre-set scenarios. We aim to contribute with a tool to drive data subjects and controllers to think about the requirements and consequences of sharing and using personal and sensitive data. Then, this tool will generate explanations regarding the data subjects' and controllers' behavior, their effects, and the risks. As the code is open-source, and the built scenarios are also available, the contribution is open to be used by any society member.\n",

    "Moreover, the developed structure could be applied in other data regulation scenarios adapting the ontology and the rules established. We tried to document as detailed as possible to allow further reuse.\n",

    "### Scenario Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario structure was developed based on the PrOnto ontology, but some changed were made. PrOnto ontology presents many modules to describe the ontology entities in details, however it might be hard to an common people, aka citizens,  to understand what are the main concerns when sharing his/her data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, we gather the PrOnto definitions to create our scenario sctructure, as depicted in the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our scenario presents five pillars: Agent, Action, Consent Term, Right, and DeonticOperator , which will be detailed and depicted below:\n",
    " - **Agent**: Scenarios have to define the agents, i.e., who are the Data Subjects, Data Controllers and Data Processors that will be involved and their actions.\n",
    " - **Action**: The actions are narrowed by the consent term, which defines the agents, the purpose, the data that will be used, and the time frame. Moreover, the actions are executed under a jurisdiction and entail risks, such as the risk of a data leak. Last but not least, actions are composed of steps, which are executed based on the current rights available for the agents and persisted by log registries. Moreover, the Action can be classified by types, which will help the explanation process filtering the activity log.\n",
    " - **Consent Term**: As the study object, the consent term has an important role in defining all required information to let the data subject be aware of data sharing conditions, narrow the data controller actions and context of use the data subjects information.\n",
    " - **Right**: The agents may have different rights depending on the classification, time frame and previous actions. The rights are complemented by the Deontic Operators.\n",
    " - **Deontic Operator**: The deontic concepts defines if there is an obligation, prohibition, and permission. Furthermore, PrOnto includes violation and compliance as status related to an obligation or prohibition as well.\n",
    " \n",
    "All actions are persisted in an **activity log** to be used as a explanation evidence. The logs are composed of: \n",
    "\n",
    "<ol type=\"i\">\n",
    "  <li>action description;</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "Our scenarios follows the structure presented below. First, we define the scenario context and formulate basic questions regarding the data subject's rights and how the data controller can address such questions. Then, we elaborate more complex scenarios in order to explore non-trivial situations to stress the scenario context and document the evidence. We aim to create a simulation tool that data subjects and controllers can explore the possible scenarios already developed and contribute with new perspectives. The collaborative contribution can generate a solid database for exploring LGPD compliance in many different situations.\n",

    "### Educational Scenario Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Subject is a 17 years old person that will start having classes at XYZ University.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Subject John is a 17 years old person, and he is going to start taking classes at XYZ University. However, as John is below 18 years old, i.e., he is considered a child under Brazilian law, he needs his parents to accept the consent terms to start the academic activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Consent Term**\n",
    "Therefore, the University has to get John's personal data and request the consent term acceptance to his parents. John has to inform the following data:\n",
    " - Full Name - used to identify the person\n",
    " - Address - used to keep communication by mail\n",
    " - Email - used to keep communication by the internet\n",
    " - Gender - used to create University's reports <Choose as many as you like: Male, Female, Non-binary, Transgender, Intersex, I prefer not to say>\n",
    " - Birth - used to decide if the student is a person that can respond by their acts or if his/her parents have to sign on behalf of the student, i.e., if the student is below 18 years old (in Brazil).\n",
    " - Personal Identification Number - used to check the person's identity\n",
    " - Educational Transcripts - used to prove that the student has the minimum requirements to become the University's student.\n",
    " - Mother's Name - used to request legal action while the student is below 18 years old\n",
    " - Father's Name - used to request legal action while the student is below 18 years old\n",
    " \n",
    "Therefore, from Wednesday, May 26, 2021 1:21:00 PM to Thursday, November 25, 2021 1:21:00 PM, when the student become above 18 years old, the student's parents will be the legal persons who will respond on his behalf. The University will share the student's data following the government guidelines, but it will not share any information with unauthorized third parties. The University's professors will be able to get all the discipline scores when the student subscribe to their new disciplines. The professors are able to request such information when creating the discipline, if needed and justified. Also, the University will apply cryptographic algorithms and access politics to avoid data breaches and unauthorized access. The personal and sensitive data will be stored in a private cloud where the University has complete control of applied technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the University, i.e., the Data Controller, must send the consent term to John and his parents, i.e., the Data Subject. The consent term must present all the information defined in the LGPD art. 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices:\n",
    " - The University should require a new student acceptance regarding the consent term when he/she changes from below 18 years old to above years old, i.e., when the student becomes an adult legally.\n",
    " - When the student becomes an adult legally, the University should communicate to his/her parents, notifying that they are no longer the legal student's legal representative.\n",
    " - XYZ University should not request any data without a justification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semestral Consent Term Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each semester, the University should require the student's consent to remember that the data might be shared with the university professors to which the student has subscribed. Moreover, the University's professor should be able to:\n",
    " - Require the student course information in the consent term.\n",
    " - Set the student's transcripts as required information to subscribe to their classes.\n",
    "   - If a professor request the transcripts, he/she has to inform why this information will be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents\n",
    " - Data Subject - John\n",
    " - Data Controller and processor - University XYZ\n",
    "\n",
    "Action\n",
    " - Defined in the consent term.\n",
    " - Risk: data breach - impact: medium; even though there is no religion, ethic, and political opinion data, the student's transcripts may generate discrimination actions to the data subject.\n",
    "    - Risk analysis definition: Low: when there is no sensitive data requisition; Medium: there are no sensitive data foreseen in the LGPD, but there are data that may generate discrimination actions to the data subject; High: There is at least one sensitive data foreseen in the LGPD shared with the data controller.\n",
    " - Juristiction: Brazilian Law\n",
    " \n",
    "Consent Term\n",
    " - As the scenario description has all the required information for a consent term, it will be considered as the consent term on this occasion.\n",
    " - As John is under 18 years old, his parents should accept the consent term on his behalf; hence, it will be considered as a proxy consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right\n",
    " - After the Data Subject's parents decide to agree with the consent terms, the data subject will have all the LGPD foreseen rights. The Data Subject should require their rights using his parents as a proxy.\n",
    " - The consent revocation:\n",
    "     - should not impact the other rights;\n",
    "     - may implies in the student impediment if a professor required the transcipt as a indispensable information;\n",
    "     - may prevent the student to contribute in a work group (for instance if the professor needs the student course name information to prepare any specific material, the student that revoke the consent should not be able to participate in the group generation)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Deontic Operator\n",
    " - The Data Subject has the permission to call for any action related to his rights\n",
    " - The Data Controller is obligated to abide by the Data Subject solicitations, except when the law says the opposite.\n",
    " - The Data Controller is prohibited from using the personal data collected under other circumstances than the ones that are in the consent term\n",
    " - Violation and compliance will be explored in the extended scenarios in the end of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suddenly the Data Subject decided to revoke his consent before the classes had started.\n",

    "Fig.5 - Macro Scenario Process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, other four cause-effect scenarios were explored in order to show some possibilities regarding to the data subject's rights. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to creating a scenario with Prolog to explore the facts in different time range and some cause-effect scenarios. This notebook tries to keep general facts that could occurr in any domain. Specific domain facts were not exploered.\n",

The client information should be migrated from one company to another. Second, like streaming video companies, data portability may mean just the act of copying the data to another company. Both companies would have the same client data at the moment of data portability request. \n",
