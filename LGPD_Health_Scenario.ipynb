    "The Data Controller RioHealth wants to use John's (Data Subject) personal data and health data to research genetic factors related to COVID-19 from Wednesday, May 26, 2021 1:21:00 PM to Thursday, November 26, 2021 1:21:00 PM (180 days). Also, RioHealth will apply cryptographic algorithms and access politics to avoid data breaches and unauthorized access. The personal and sensitive data will be stored in a private cloud where RioHealth has complete control of applied technologies. Furthermore, RioHealth is committed to sharing the data with third parties if the purpose is vaccination prioritization information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the Data Controller must send the consent term to the Data Subject. The consent term must present all the information defined in the LGPD art. 9.\n",

    "   - Medium: there are no sensitive data foreseen in the LGPD, but there are data that may generate discrimination actions to the data subject; \n",

    " - Jurisdiction: Brazilian Law\n",

    " - The consent revocation should not impact the other rights.\n",

    "Deontic Operator\n",
    " - The Data Subject has the permission to call for any action related to his rights\n",
    " - The Data Controller is obligated to abide by the Data Subject solicitations, except when the law says the opposite.\n",
    " - The Data Controller is prohibited from using the personal data collected under other circumstances than the ones that are in the consent term\n",
